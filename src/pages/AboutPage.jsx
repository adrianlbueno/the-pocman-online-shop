            Hi! My name is Adrian Bueno
          </h1>
          <p>
            Born in Ecuador and shaped by rich colors and traditions, I later
            moved to New York, where I spent years working, studying, and
            following my dreams. Today, Münster is home, the place where The
            Pocman began. What started as a small hobby slowly grew into
            something that could live anywhere — on a t-shirt, on the street, or
            in the digital world.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m now working toward a new chapter: founding my own animation
            studio, where art, stories, and technology come together to help
            others bring their ideas to life.
