                        Digital design, street art, development, and illustration. For me, creativity has always been
                        about shaping the world, expressing emotions, and telling stories without saying a word.

                        Born in Ecuador and raised among rich colors and traditions, I later moved to New York, where
                        the city’s raw energy and endless creativity pushed my vision further. Today, Münster, Germany
                        is home, a beautiful place where I collaborate with other artists and continue growing my
                        craft.

                        Coffee in the morning, long conversations with friends, spontaneous laughter. Life’s simple
                        moments inspire me deeply. I see life itself as a story we are all constantly writing.

                        Right now, I'm building toward a new chapter: founding my own animation studio, where art,
                        stories, and technology will meet and move people in new ways.
